1.1 Structural Health Monitoring via GNSS

Since the mid-1990, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have been used to 
monitor dynamic deformation of structures such as long bridges, towers and tall 
buildings, mainly to investigate structural vibrations induced by a wide variety 
of sources (e.g. wind, temperature, traffic, etc). This process of implementing 
damage detection and performance analysis strategies for engineering structures 
are defined as Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) [Kaloop et al, 2017]. SHM 
systems are utilized to analyze and predict the health state of structures 
under unknown future environmental conditions.

SHM via GNSS is mostly performed in complement to a series of in-situ sensors, 
such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc . That is due to a series of limiting 
factors, such as:
  * limited accuracy of GNSS
  * data sampling/acquisition rates
  * obstacles in the surrounding area (such as tall buildings, antennas)  
    especially for urban areas
  * complicated and time consuming data analysis requirements

With the constant advance in recent years in the field of GNSS, geodetic 
monitoring systems are developed especially for structures’ monitoring. 
According to [Im et al, 2013], GNSS currently represent the highest 
advanced geodetic monitoring systems used to evaluate structures’ behavior.
GNSS monitoring systems are improved to measure dynamic responses up to 50Hz 
[Yi et al, 2013], hence enabling the monitoring of a wide range of structures, 
such as dams, long- and short-span bridges, seismic evaluations, and tall 
buildings.

Using a real-time kinematic (RTK) approach, GNSS measurements can reach an 
accuracy of a few centimeters (typically 1-5cm [Yi et al, 2013]), while recent  
experiments conducted using the Precise Point Processing (PPP) approach have 
also reported same levels of accuracy [Moschas et al, 2015].

GNSS sampling frequency plays a dominant part in dynamic performance analysis. 
Over the past few years, there was significant improvement in the development 
of new methods and new hardware that increase the sampling frequency and signal 
collection techniques. Currently, GNSS receivers can collect observations with 
a sampling rate up to 100Hz. This fact raises the question of whether these 
systems can be used to monitor stiff structures, especially bridges and cantilever 
structures members with dominant frequencies greater than 3–4Hz, and dynamic 
movements of the order of a few millimeters. Such short-span bridges represent 
the majority of bridges on a global scale. Such structures represent a challenge 
because the 100Hz GPS sampling rate is compatible with the accelerometers’ 
sampling rate (100–200Hz) that are systematically used for structural analysis, 
whereas 100Hz data make it possible to overcome any problem of aliasing in stiff 
structures’ spectral data [Moschas et al 2014]. In addition, such data can 
typically overcome the problem of loss of peaks or of amplitude amplification 
[Moschas et al, 2015]. Very few studies have investigated experimentally the 
noise characteristics of 100Hz GPS data. In addition, this technology has been 
applied only in very few cases of relatively flexible structures (dominant 
frequencies of approximately 1.5Hz).

1.2 GNSS Monitoring Techniques

There are two basic modes of operation for GNSS; Point Positioning (PP), where 
the user utilizes the observations collected by a single receiver (or multiple 
receivers individually) and differential/network positioning (DGPS) where 
observations from multiple (at least two) receivers are combined and processed 
together. Both techniques offer a series of advantages and pose disadvantages 
and have been used for SHM. Typically, differential positioning offers improved 
accuracy compared to point positioning, posing however serious processing 
challenges and limitations (larger analysis requirements).

With the advance in GNSS hardware and methodologies (e.g. Precise Point 
Positioning), the two methods can now reach accuracies of a few centimeters, 
depending however on a large set of factors (processing mode, error and noise 
mitigation, environmental conditions, etc).

Additionally, data processing can be performed in either real-time or 
post-processing mode, for both PP and DGPS. Analysis in post-processing mode 
can offer significant advantages, but is not always fit for SHM.

While there are a few software packages that can perform high standard GNSS 
analysis in post-processing mode (e.g. Bernese, GIPSY/OSASIS, Gamit --TODO refs here--), 
there is a lack of tools when it comes to real-time processing. Normally, users 
would resolve to the non-free, non-open source tools developed by GNSS receiver 
manufacturers (e.g. [], []--TODO refs here--). These however, are usually 
surveying oriented, thus posing limitations to SHM.
