1. Excellence, State-of-the-art and objectives 

1.1 Structural Health Monitoring via GNSS

Since the mid-1990, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have been used to 
monitor dynamic deformation of structures such as long bridges, towers and tall 
buildings, mainly to investigate structural vibrations induced by a wide variety 
of sources (e.g. wind, temperature, traffic, etc). This process of implementing 
damage detection and performance analysis strategies for engineering structures 
are defined as Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) [Kaloop et al, 2017]. SHM 
systems are utilized to analyze and predict the health state of structures 
under unknown future environmental conditions.

SHM via GNSS is mostly performed in complement to a series of in-situ sensors, 
such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc . That is due to a series of limiting 
factors, such as:
  * limited accuracy of GNSS
  * data sampling/acquisition rates
  * obstacles in the surrounding area (such as tall buildings, antennas)  
    especially for urban areas
  * complicated and time consuming data analysis requirements

With the constant advance in recent years in the field of GNSS, geodetic 
monitoring systems are developed especially for structures’ monitoring. 
According to [Im et al, 2013], GNSS currently represent the highest 
advanced geodetic monitoring systems used to evaluate structures’ behavior.
GNSS monitoring systems are improved to measure dynamic responses up to 50Hz 
[Yi et al, 2013], hence enabling the monitoring of a wide range of structures, 
such as dams, long- and short-span bridges, seismic evaluations, and tall 
buildings.

Using a real-time kinematic (RTK) approach, GNSS measurements can reach an 
accuracy of a few centimeters (typically 1-5cm [Yi et al, 2013]), while recent  
experiments conducted using the Precise Point Processing (PPP) approach have 
also reported same levels of accuracy [Moschas et al, 2015].

GNSS sampling frequency plays a dominant part in dynamic performance analysis. 
Over the past few years, there was significant improvement in the development 
of new methods and new hardware that increase the sampling frequency and signal 
collection techniques. Currently, GNSS receivers can collect observations with 
a sampling rate up to 100Hz. This fact raises the question of whether these 
systems can be used to monitor stiff structures, especially bridges and cantilever 
structures members with dominant frequencies greater than 3–4Hz, and dynamic 
movements of the order of a few millimeters. Such short-span bridges represent 
the majority of bridges on a global scale. Such structures represent a challenge 
because the 100Hz GPS sampling rate is compatible with the accelerometers’ 
sampling rate (100–200Hz) that are systematically used for structural analysis, 
whereas 100Hz data make it possible to overcome any problem of aliasing in stiff 
structures’ spectral data [Moschas et al 2014]. In addition, such data can 
typically overcome the problem of loss of peaks or of amplitude amplification 
[Moschas et al, 2015]. Very few studies have investigated experimentally the 
noise characteristics of 100Hz GPS data. In addition, this technology has been 
applied only in very few cases of relatively flexible structures (dominant 
frequencies of approximately 1.5Hz).

1.2 GNSS Monitoring Techniques

There are two basic modes of operation for GNSS; Point Positioning (PP), where 
the user utilizes the observations collected by a single receiver (or multiple 
receivers individually) and differential/network positioning (DGPS) where 
observations from multiple (at least two) receivers are combined and processed 
together. Both techniques offer a series of advantages and pose disadvantages 
and have been used for SHM. Typically, differential positioning offers improved 
accuracy compared to point positioning, posing however serious processing 
challenges and limitations (larger analysis requirements).

With the advance in GNSS hardware and methodologies (e.g. Precise Point 
Positioning), the two methods can now reach accuracies of a few centimeters, 
depending however on a large set of factors (processing mode, error and noise 
mitigation, environmental conditions, etc).

Additionally, data processing can be performed in either real-time or 
post-processing mode, for both PP and DGPS. Analysis in post-processing mode 
can offer significant advantages, but is not always fit for SHM.

While there are a few software packages that can perform high standard GNSS 
analysis in post-processing mode (e.g. Bernese, GIPSY/OSASIS, Gamit --TODO refs here--), 
there is a lack of tools when it comes to real-time processing. Normally, users 
would resolve to the non-free, non-open source tools developed by GNSS receiver 
manufacturers (e.g. [], []--TODO refs here--). These however, are usually 
surveying oriented, thus posing limitations to SHM.

1.3 Proposal objectives and challenges

1.4 State-of-the-art & Innovation

SHM by means of GNSS is a rapidly growing technology. Especially during the 
last years, with the rapid advancement of GNSS hardware and methodologies, it 
has started to attract the interest of a growing number of researchers around 
the world. The limits of this technology are yet to be discovered.

Within the framework of the current research project, we aim at exploring and 
implementing state-of-the art technology, using innovative methods to surpass 
current limitations. More specifically, we intend to address the following 
issues:

* Lack of Software
  ----------------
As stated above (--TODO where above?--), there is an apparent lack of software 
when it comes to the specific needs of implementing an SHM platform via GNSS. 
Most research groups have used packages and tools designed by receiver 
manufacturing companies (e.g. --TODO refs here--), which however pose several 
limitations, such as:
  * non-free and non-open source software; that is users have to purchase these 
  tools and are confined to their inherent methodologies, design and limitations. 
  Due to copyright limitations, even sophisticated users cannot alter the 
  software, to fit their specific needs.
  * surveying oriented; receiver manufacturing companies usually design software 
  packages aimed and oriented towards surveying needs. That means that precision 
  and accuracy standards are not high enough to meet the demands of high-precision 
  GNSS applications, such as SHM.
  * not state-of-the-art methodologies; these software packages are developed 
  to be user-friendly and reliable above all. Using and/or testing state-of-the-art 
  techniques, algorithms and methodologies is not a design objective and is 
  neglected in production code.

High precision, scientific oriented GNSS processing software packages (Bernese, 
GAMIT, GIPSY -- TODO refs here--) on the other hand, offer significant 
advantages when it comes to state-of-the-art analysis techniques, but have 
important drawbacks when it comes to implementing SHM related applications. 
The dominant disadvantages are:

  * no real-time analysis; such software tools are designed to perform 
  post-processing data analysis. Users first collect/acquire the dataset and 
  in a latter step "feed" the software using a batch processing mode. Real-time 
  data streams cannot be handled, thus inhibiting real-time monitoring.
  * no high-rate data analysis; most of the high-precision GNSS analysis tools, 
  are designed with the main focus being the processing of static, 30 second 
  data. With that being the main goal, analysis of high rate GNSS data (i.e. 
  sampling rates higher than 5-10Hz) is either not feasible at all, or 
  inefficient (--TODO check this a bit more--).
  * no or inefficient RTK mode; as stated above, such software is oriented 
  towards a post-processing static analysis. Hence processing data in RTK mode 
  is usually inefficient, if offered at all
  * not user-friendly; scientific, high precision software is aimed towards an 
  educated audience, mostly scientists and researchers involved in GNSS analysis. 
  SHM though, could be a field of study for researchers of various scientific 
  backgrounds (e.g. civil engineers), not necessarily related to in-depth GNSS 
  analysis techniques.

* GNSS Analysis Current Problems and Limitations
------------------------------------------------
Analysis of high-rate GNSS data, especially for sampling rates higher than 5Hz, 
poses a series of problems and challenges not yet fully understood. Due to the 
fact that this technology became only recently available, a wide range of 
scientific questions has risen and remains unanswered.

Processing methodologies for the efficient handling of such high-rate datasets 
are currently in a premature phase. We aim to address such questions and come 
up with innovative solutions and propositions. More specifically, we aim at 
studying:

  * efficient, real-time GNSS analysis techniques, implementing modern, 
  state-of-the-art data processing algorithms. Scientific computation methods 
  are now mature enough to handle large volume data in ever decreasing response 
  times. We intend to implement modern software design, using tools such as 
  distributing processing and multi-threading, to test the limits of read-time, 
  high-rate GNSS analysis.
  * inherent observation correlation of high-rate data; observations collected 
  at such high frequencies (>10Hz), are highly correlated, posing serious 
  challenges in their analysis (high levels of redundancy and dependence, can 
  lead to ill-formatted matrices). We intend to examine the issue in detail, 
  proposing ways to handle correlation, select optimal data and analysis 
  sampling rates (depending on the dynamic model under consideration, e.g. 
  vibration frequency under study).
  * noise characteristics of high frequency GNSS observations; this is a topic 
  of great importance for the efficient and accurate processing of high-rate 
  observations and their respective statistical analysis and evaluation. Recent 
  studies have shown that error sources affect monitoring systems for both short 
  and long monitoring times (e.g. [Moschas et al, 2013]); some researchers 
  introduced methods that can be used to detect the behavior of structures using 
  noise and error performances. For example, Peppa et al. [49] used the 
  signal-to-noise ratio of GPS measurements to detect structures movements. 
  Moreover, Souza and Negri [50] utilized the multipath effect to detect 
  structure movements. Mitigation and/or modeling of errors and noise is of the 
  highest importance in GNSS analysis, yet not fully understood and studied in 
  the case of high-rate, high precision applications.
  * multipath effects; this can be one of the main factors of precision 
  degradation in GNSS-based SHM applications ([27,28]) and one of the errors 
  hardest to model and mitigate efficiently. Especially in the case of SHM, 
  where large structures are under consideration, multipath induced errors can 
  cause severe loss of accuracy.
  * PPP ambiguity resolution; in recent years, the PPP methodology is used in 
  an ever growing number of applications. With the recent advances in GNSS 
  technology, the precision offered by this algorithm is rapidly approximating 
  the one reached by DGPS. Especially in real-time applications, where processing 
  speed is of the highest importance, this methodology offers great advantages. 
  However, these is still a limiting factor difficult to transcend and that is 
  effective ambiguity resolution. Resolving ambiguities to whole cycles (integers) 
  can improve GNSS positioning accuracy, but the integer character of ambiguities 
  is lost in PPP (where in contrast to DGPS common errors between receiver/antenna 
  pairs are not differenced out).
